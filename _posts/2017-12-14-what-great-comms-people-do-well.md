What Great Comms People do Well

Article 3: Engage People Brilliantly

The ability to listen and engage effectively with people may sound simple enough - and something people feel they do on a day-to-day basis - but at times of stress or even crisis, it's not always as obvious as it may sound. Here are some ways that great comms people engage through change.

**Quickly build great relationships** -- it's important you get to know the people you are working for and with, and build up strong relationships with them from the beginning. Doing this on both a personal and professional level will help you to understand them and their needs.

**Go the extra mile to keep everyone with an interest informed**-- where change is involved, people like to be kept up to date and know what's going on. Be creative with your stakeholder list and make sure you have everyone possible covered. This may mean extra work for you but it will save you pain in the longer term -- as all sorts of people you may not have thought of may start getting nervous and taking an interest close to implementation.

**Treat your audiences like customers** -- segment your market, identify benefits and tailor messages. Keep your messages as simple as possible and relate them to specific audience groups. Put yourself in the shoes of your listener. If you have the time, create a user journey for each group -- how will they be feeling and what will they need to do at each stage of implementation. What materials can you create to help inform and reassure? Think of your communications as an intervention to support people and move them round the change curve.

**Create great quality engagement materials** -- it's always easier to think tactically about change communications. Operationally, we need just to make sure people know what they need to just get the message out there. But again -- thinking of your audience as customers -- what will or won't they look at or pay attention to? The marketing model AIDA \[Attention, Interest, Desire, Action\] is a simple way to think about your communications. Look and feel is important in getting attention, as is a strong opening statement. Sending long emails or posting info in underused intranets won't get attention. Get people's interest by making the info relevant to them and their lives and work. Create a desire for action by building and sharing the case for change -- the compelling story and the proof points that sit underneath it. Only then can you expect people to take action. You need to be very clear about what that call to action is -- whether it's to change the way they do something or do something new.

**Get to the bottom of people's issues and help to resolve them** -- being an effective listener and acting on what you hear, will ensure you are clear about what the potential problems people have with whatever you are introducing or changing. It's so important to tease out what these are and it can take quite a few conversations to get to the real reasons that people are objecting. Persevere -- again -- it will save you pain in the longer term and stop people raising obstacles at the last minute.

**Don't forget the big picture story and internal PR** -- it's important to remember that the organization as a whole is one of your audience groups. A big change can represent a financial investment -- whose success or failure impact the company and the reputation of the people who are leading or sponsoring the change. Set up channels to keep this audience regularly informed, ensure you have a high level organizational story around the change and be sure to celebrate successes along your journey.

These are just a few things great comms people do to engage their audiences but there are so many more! I'd love to hear your thoughts on what you do brilliantly to engage through change!
