What Great Comms People do Well

Article 1: Tell the Truth Kindly

I was thinking this morning about 'spin'.

'Spin' was a phrase that was particularly well used during Tony Blair's government, to call out the practice of making things sound better than they actually were. And there are certainly newspapers that 'spin' stories in different ways to suit their own political line or rouse some passions.

But in general, I believe comms professionals have a great integrity and respect for the truth. 

Writing or editing a piece of copy to reflect accurately, yet unemotionally, all aspects of a story, to tone down inflammatory wording or take into account stakeholder sensitivities is a real skill that communications professionals have.

Using the term 'spin' when used to refer to this kind of writing is I think unfair. I think what we do as comms professionals is to try to 'tell the truth kindly'

What do you think? Do you spin or tell the truth kindly? Or have you been at the receiving end of one or the other?
