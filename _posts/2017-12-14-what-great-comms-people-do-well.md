What Great Comms People do Well

Article 2: Calm the Storm

More often than not, with great comms, less is more!

I've worked in comms through various crises and high profile changes and events and the one thing that always springs to mind is the less you hear about it, the better the comms have been. Careful internal and external stakeholder engagement and messaging is critical to keeping the focus on the facts at hand rather than spinning wildly off into the realms of lurid tabloid headlines. If this is done successfully, then you may hear barely a whisper in the media about whatever issue it is that you are managing.

The other hugely important, yet underrated skill of a great comms person or function is their ability to keep themselves and others calm during a 'crisis' or other period of business difficulty or change. For example if something goes off in the press, if there is a strike, a disaster or a protest; it's easy for a sense of panic to start to ripple through an organization and its leadership. 

On a practical level, it's very important to keep people within the organization fully appraised of the facts around the issue by setting up a cadence of regular communications; including for example an immediate communication from a senior leader, a planned regular briefing and a route for questions. 

Also it's very important to ensure that all of the language and messaging around the issue is non emotive, sensitive to any personal feelings and fact based. Central messaging needs to be developed to be used consistently by all leaders and communications people. Everyone wants to keep their people and contacts up to date, so without a central narrative, stories can become very different from facts.

The comms leader should be positioned perfectly in the eye of the storm, guiding, reassuring and facilitating the right messaging to the right people.

Or in the case of a great comms leader, there may well be no storm at all!
