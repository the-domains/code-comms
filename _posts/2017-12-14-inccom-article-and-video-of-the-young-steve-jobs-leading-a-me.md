Inc.com Article & Video of the Young Steve Jobs Leading a Meeting

I took the time this morning to read this post and watch this video on Steve Jobs leading a retreat for his new startup back in 1985 after he left Apple. There really is a lot for all leaders and entrepreneurs to learn from him. In particular, his ability to communicate and promote belief in a vision. Well worth watching the 20 minute version if you have the time. Alternatively there are time codes so you can skip to relevant parts.

_" It's an incredible feeling to know that you had something to do with it and to know that it can be done. To know that you can plant something in the world and that it will grow, and change the world ever so slightly." Steve Jobs 1985_
